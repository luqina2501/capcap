# Requirement 4
## Focus on UI.Left
+ clearly the progress size is still wrong (it should cover the full width of the UI.Left)
+ the "absoulte_top" of UI.Left is blocking the site of the image
+ make caption_short and caption_detail easier to read, and they shouldn't be boxed in a scrollable container
+ also, where are the options to edit the captions?

# Requirement 5
+ implement save button(in replacement for edit button if edit button is clicked) for both captions
+ why did you block other question after I choose "no"?

# Requirement 6
+ Move the search option from Filter options to UI.Left.Top, also allow users to enter and see past edited/saved entries.
+ change the layout of the UI:
  + UI.Left don't show captions below the image anymore
  + Move captions to UI.Right.Top (fixed position)
  + Above change_log and under other questions, show all the ticked and synced public.auto_flags, asking users to confirm whether they are correct. if no then let them edit the tick_box_list.

# Requirement 7
+ Also move the filter options to UI.Left.Top while still seperate it from the search option (make the high higher for easier readability)
+ Match the color of Captions with the rest of UI.Right
