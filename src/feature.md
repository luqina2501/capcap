# Requirement 4
## Focus on UI.Left
+ clearly the progress size is still wrong (it should cover the full width of the UI.Left)
+ the "absoulte_top" of UI.Left is blocking the site of the image
+ make caption_short and caption_detail easier to read, and they shouldn't be boxed in a scrollable container
+ also, where are the options to edit the captions?

# Requirement 5
+ implement save button(in replacement for edit button if edit button is clicked) for both captions
+ why did you block other question after I choose "no"?
